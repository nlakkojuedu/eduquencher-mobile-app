# Quick Android SDK Setup (Without Android Studio)

## Method 1: Install Command Line Tools Only

1. Download Android SDK Command Line Tools:
   https://developer.android.com/studio#command-tools

2. Extract to: C:\Android\cmdline-tools\latest\

3. Set Environment Variables:
   - ANDROID_HOME: C:\Android
   - Add to PATH: C:\Android\cmdline-tools\latest\bin
   - Add to PATH: C:\Android\platform-tools

4. Install required packages:
   ```
   sdkmanager "platform-tools" "platforms;android-34" "build-tools;34.0.0"
   ```

## Method 2: Use APK Build Service (No SDK Required)

If you can't install SDK tools, we can:
1. Build APK on a remote service
2. Download and install on your device manually

## Method 3: Use Online Build Services

Services like:
- Ionic AppFlow (https://ionic.io/appflow)
- GitHub Actions (free CI/CD)
- Can build your APK without local Android SDK

## Current Project Status

Your EduQuencher app is ready:
‚úÖ All code complete
‚úÖ Android project configured
‚úÖ All plugins included
‚úÖ Build successful

Only missing: Android SDK for device deployment

## Quick Test Option

If you have access to another computer with Android Studio:
1. Copy the entire project folder
2. Run `ionic capacitor open android`
3. Install APK to your device

## What happens when you connect your phone:

Once you have minimal SDK:
```bash
# Check if device is connected
adb devices

# Install and run the app
ionic capacitor run android --target YOUR_DEVICE_ID
```

Your EduQuencher app will:
üì± Launch with native Android interface
üåê Open EduQuencher website perfectly
üîô Handle back button properly
üì≤ Show splash screen
‚ö° Work smoothly with all features!
